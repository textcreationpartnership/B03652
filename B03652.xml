            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To his Grace, His Majesties high Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable the Eſtates of Parliament.
<hi>Mr. Allexander Higgins</hi> of <hi>Craigforth,</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Humbly ſheweth,</opener>
            <p>THat where <hi>John Callender</hi> having given in to your Grace and Lordſhips a ſecond Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, either contradicting in a moſt calumnious manner, the matter of Fact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in my Petition, or telling a Story, that doth not at all meet with his Caſe; which is done induſtriouſly to amuſe the World, and to alleviat the groſs Crimes, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Practices, that are proven againſt him: Being the ordinar remedy that Malefactors uſe in the like Caſe, till the very Sentence be pronounced againſt them: But I being <hi>in Libello,</hi> founded upon a Probation already adduced, the half whereof is ſufficient to pr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cure a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand to proſecute a Criminal, for putting ſuch unaccountable Tricks upon the Publick. It is hoped with all ſubmiſſion, that no ſuch Impudent denial of the true Matter of Fact, can put a ſtop thereto; And if your Grace, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, will be pleaſed to ordain the Sub-Committee upon that Affair, to compare the Depoſitions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtructions with what is repreſented by me in my ſaid Petition, it will be found, that I have uſed very much Precaution, that I might not exceed the true Matter of Fact; and if it ſhall be found otherways, I am willing to ſubject my ſelf immediatly to the moſt ſevere puniſhment that can be thought upon: So that it is humbly expected, that your Grace and Lordſhips will think it the Concern of the Publick, that your Petitioner acting in a Publick Capacity, by virtue of His Majeſties Commiſſion, this matter ſhould be put to a ſpeedy tryal, which will both vindicat me, and make his foreſaid Petition a conſiderable aggravation of his Guilt, in ſtead of having the ſucceſs that he moſt fraudulently deſigneth <unclear>by</unclear> it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the ſaid <hi>John Callender</hi> (to compleat his Cavelling in his ſaid Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) maketh a Counter-charge of ſome pretended Crimes againſt your Petitioner, <hi>viz.</hi> the Suborning of Witneſſes, and granting double Rights: But to demonſtrate that theſe Sham Calumnies are moſt ridiculous, and uſed by him of purpoſe, to divert the courſe of Juſtice againſt himſelf. I not only heartily comply that he ſhould inſiſt againſt me, but alſo, that (in caſe I be found guilty in the leaſt of what he hath the groundleſs impudence to aſſert) the puniſhment due by the Acts of Parliament to ſuch Crimes, may be doubled againſt me. Neither ſhall I offer (in compenſation of this falſe Accuſation) to mention his manner of dealing with privat perſons, both of the Nobility and Gentry, which is ſo much noiſed abroad through the Nation.</p>
            <p>May it therefore pleaſe your Grace, and the Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, to ordain the ſaid Sub-Committee to compare the foreſaids Depoſitions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtructions, with my foreſaid Petition for my Vindication: And if their Lordſhips have not time to determine the matter themſelves, during this Seſſion of Parliament, To remit to the Lords of Juſticiary the Criminal part of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; And to the Lords of the Theſaury and Exchequer, to ſtate and conclude the compt and Reckoning, according to the deſire of my foreſaid Petition,</p>
            <closer>And your Petitioner ſhall ever pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </closer>
